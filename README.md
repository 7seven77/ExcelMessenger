# NellyDilemmaIM

In the music video for the song Dilemma by Nella (Feat. Kelly Rowland), Kelly Rowland can be seen sending a message using Excel.
I saw people ridiculing this and claiming this was stupid because it cannot be done.

I am planning to create some subroutines in vba as well as some pages for a website which allow Excel to be used as an "instant messaging" application
